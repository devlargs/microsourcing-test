# Drone Challenge

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- Vite (A fast build tool for modern frontend development)
- React Context (for state management)
- Mantine (for the main user interface)
- Typescript (ensuring type safety and better developer experience)

## 🛠️ Setting up the project

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

## 🤖 Running the Front End


```sh
# You must first run the api
yarn watch:api
```

The api will start running at `http://localhost:4001`.

```sh
# Then run the dev command
yarn dev
```

This will start the app on a local development server.

## 🔗 Productionizing the app

- For the frontend, I've used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to cater vite app.
- For the backend, I've used [Render](https://render.com/) to cater the web service.
